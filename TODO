* Try to configure automatically as many stuff as possible:
    - toolchain.mk
    - map.mk
    - dependencies
    - features toggling

* split install target in the ordered dep "beforeinstall" "realinstall" 
  "afterinstall".

* Set the "install" target dependency on "all" explicitly.

* Improve subdir.mk: at present make doesn't stop on error in a subdir. 

* Improve lib.mk to support shared libs (in a portable fashion ...)

* Think about the "configure" way: 
    - target
    - features
    - language
