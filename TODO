* Set the "install" target dependency on "all" explicitly.
* Improve lib.mk to support shared libs: this could be done by splitting 
  lib.mk into a platform independent staticlib.mk and a platform specific 
  dynlib.mk to be installed on MaKL setup (pretty much like toolchain files).
* mkdep for platform missing it (for gcc we could use NetBSD's).
