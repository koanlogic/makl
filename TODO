* avoid multiple inclusion of .mk files (i.e. ifndef __prog_mk__ ... endif)
* check preconditions for all the user supplied variables needed by .mk files 
  (i.e. mk_precond function needed)
* more testing needed for shared libraries on BSD platforms
* cf/makl_{answer,question} for interactive settings
* a better integration with GNU make internal variables' data base ?

* it would be nice to have "makl-nutshells", i.e. private and self-contained
  makl environments: they'd be created and accessed easily (with minimal 
  user intervention) and would be "local" to a given user or build context.

  makl nutshell MAKL_NUTSHELL=/makl/nutshell/dir \
                MAKL_PLATFORM=/my/makl/toolchain_and_sharedlib_basename

  or:

  makl nutshell MAKL_NUTSHELL=/makl/nutshell/dir \
                MAKL_TC=/my/makl/toolchain_file  \
                MAKL_SHLIB=/my/makl/shlib_file

  if MAKL_SHLIB is not set null.shlib will be used

* set of bourne shell helper functions for common tasks that can be invoked 
  via 'call'

* makl-new <lib|prog|subdir|xeno|include|script|file|man|dist> 
  takes a template file and writes it to the current working dir

* add 'help' target to each .mk template that shows available variables
  and target it exports
