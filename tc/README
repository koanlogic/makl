Toolchain files

  A .tc file is a list of 'NAME = value' pairs each of which corresponds to a 
  given toolchain object or to an object parameter (e.g. compiler, compiler
  command line arguments, linker, etc).  
  The right side value is optional, e.g. 'LDFLAGS = '.

  Lines in a .tc file that refer to toolchain objects MUST begin with a 
  CAPITALIZED letter.  Only lines beginning with a capitalized letter are 
  picked up and used to produce the Bourne shell and GNU/P make compatible 
  toolchain files (in doubt see ../setup/toolchain_setup.sh).
 
  On MaKL installation the platform is (should be) autodetected and the right 
  toolchain selected accordingly.  Two files, ${MAKL_DIR}/cf/toolchain.sh and 
  ${MAKL_DIR}/mk/toolchain.mk are then automatically generated.  
 
  Changes to the toolchain should always be done in the .tc file and then 
  propagated to .mk and .sh via the ${MAKL_DIR}/setup/toolchain_setup.sh' 
  script.  This is especially true when you are rolling your own .tc file 
  because of a special need (e.g. you're using another compiler, or have to 
  adjust some command line flags) or because your platform is not yet supported
  by MaKL.
  
  At present .tc files' list is very limited and coarse grained.  Our goal is
  to add incrementally as much .tc files as possible while our porting 
  experience grows.
