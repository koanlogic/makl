Toolchain files

  A .tc file is a list of 'NAME = value' pairs each of which corresponds to a 
  given toolchain object or to an object parameter (e.g. compiler, compiler
  command line arguments, linker, etc).  
  The right side value is optional, e.g. 'LDFLAGS = '.

  Lines in a .tc file that refer to toolchain objects MUST begin with a 
  CAPITALIZED letter.  Only lines beginning with a capitalized letter are 
  picked up and used to produce the Bourne shell and GNU/P make compatible 
  toolchain files (in doubt see makl_tc file).  A line beginning with a '#'
  is a comment.

  On MaKL installation the platform is (should be) autodetected and the right 
  toolchain file selected accordingly.  This file has overrides (if any) 
  for the default.tc file.  Two files, ${MAKL_DIR}/etc/toolchain.cf and 
  ${MAKL_DIR}/etc/toolchain.mk are then automatically generated.

  NOTE: the parser is rather fragile: the equal sign must be 'sp' padded both 
  left and right.
 
  Changes to the toolchain should always be done in the platform specific 
  .tc file and then propagated to .mk and .cf via the toolchain_setup.sh
  in the ${MAKL_DIR}/setup' directory.  This is especially true when you 
  are rolling your own .tc file because of a special need (e.g. you're using 
  another compiler, or have to adjust some command line flags) or because 
  your platform is not yet supported by MaKL.
  
  At present .tc files' list is quite limited and coarse grained.  Our goal
  is to add incrementally as much .tc files as possible while our porting 
  experience grows.
