- a .tc file is a list of 'name = value' pairs each of which corresponds to a 
  given toolchain object or to an object parameter (e.g. compiler, compiler
  command line arguments, linker, etc).  
  Lines in a .tc file are either 'name = value' lines, blank lines or comment
  lines.  Lines beginning with a '#' (i.e. comment lines) and blank lines are 
  ignored, 'name = value' lines are used to produce the Bourne shell and GNU/P 
  make compatible toolchain files.  Warning: due to parser limitation if a
  given name has no value counterpart, a trailing blank after the '=' is still
  needed.

- on MaKL installation the platform should be autodetected and the right 
  toolchain selected accordingly.  Two files, ${makl_dir}/cf/toolchain.sh and 
  ${makl_dir}/mk/toolchain.mk are then automatically generated.  Changes to
  the toolchain should always be done in the .tc file and then propagated to
  .mk and .sh via the 'toolchain' target of the top-level {makl_dir} Makefile.
  The latter is especially true when you are rolling your own .tc file because
  of a special need (e.g. you're using another compiler, or need to adjust some
  command line flag) or because your platform is not yet supported by MaKL.
