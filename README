MaKL is a tool to aid and ease the development of multiplatform C applications.

The MaKL package is a collection of Bourne shell functions (makl cf macros) and
template GNU Makefiles (makl mk files) which can be used together or separately
to achieve the following goals:

- Get simpler and less error prone Makefiles.  
  You just need to set a small number of variables and include the relevant 
  template Makefiles.

  e.g.:

  PROG = myprog
  SRCS = main.c aux.c
  LDADD = ../mylib/mylib.a
  DPADD = ${LDADD}
  DESTDIR = /opt/myapp/

  include prog.mk

  Then you can issue GNU make with 'all', 'clean', 'install', 'depend' and 
  'cleandepend' targets and they will do exactly what you expect.
 
- MaKL is a feature that the user can toggle on/off at will.  
  Suppose you have written your special case Makefile and you don't want MaKL 
  to interfere with it: you just don't include MaKL templates and that's it.

- Simple customization and target hacking.
  If MaKL is not sufficient to your needs and you are familiar with Makefile 
  writing, you can hack the templates, it's quite simple: they are plain, clean
  and well documented.  If you feel your modification is worth for others, you 
  are incouraged to give it back to the MaKL community.
  
- Automatic configuration.
  By including MaKL cf macros, the developer can easily create its configure
  script.  The cf macros are Bourne shell functions with a very scalable
  architecture: MaKL provides the basic building block which the developer
  can combine in order to obtain the needed functionality:

  e.g.

  makl_compile("./build/libxdep.c", "-lx") && makl_set_var("HAVE_LIBX")

  The use of Bourne shell syntax makes them easy to understand, customise, 
  extend, etc.  Again, if you feel the modifications you've added to the 
  package are worth for others, you are incouraged to give it back to the 
  MaKL community.

- Reduce system dependencies.  
  MaKL package only depends on /bin/sh for makl_cf macros and GNU make for 
  Makefile templates.

- Mantain the Autotools' phenotype.
  We want that building and installing a MaKL application from source files 
  is as simple as typing: ./configure && make install.
