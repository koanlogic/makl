Available targets:

all:        build the software from sources
clean:      undo the 'all' target
distclean:  clean + also remove files in DISTCLEANFILES (i.e. those generated 
            during the auto-configuration step)
depend:     create .depend files used by MaKL to decide when re-making a given
            target
install:    install what need to be installed: binaries, libraries, docs,
            header files, etc.
uninstall:  undo the 'install' target

Typical sequence:

$ makl-conf [...]
$ makl clean depend all
$ makl install
