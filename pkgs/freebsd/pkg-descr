MaKL is a simple and light framework for building multi-platform C projects, 
purely based on the Bourne Shell and GNU Make. It is much easier to install 
and use than other typical building systems, while maintaining the essential 
functionality.

It is ideal for embedded systems due to its cross-compilation, multiplatform 
toolchaining mechanisms, and minimal external dependencies.
