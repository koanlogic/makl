MaKL is a simple and light framework for building multi-platform C/C++ 
projects, purely based on the Bourne Shell and GNU Make.  It provides a set
of GNU make templates to ease the creation and maintenance of Makefile's, and
a rich Bourne shell API to create configure scripts.

It is ideal for embedded systems due to its cross-compilation, multiplatform
toolchaining mechanisms, and minimal external dependencies.
